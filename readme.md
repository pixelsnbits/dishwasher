2) As you’ll notice, the dishwasher is most likely empty or has plenty of room left. Take this time to transport the dirty dishes the 2 feet from the sink to the appropriate dishwasher rack.

6) And place it in the conveniently labeled receptacle at the front of the open dishwasher door. Latch the panel and then close the dishwasher door.

7) Once you close the door the dishwasher will take over from there!! Turn the label from **_Dirty_** to **_Clean_** so the next user knows what to expect when they open the door and you're finished!

8) (BONUS!) You’ll notice the timer says ~35 minutes to complete. If you want to gain a sense of accomplishment, you should go back when it’s completed and empty the dishwasher so that someone else can enjoy the experience!
